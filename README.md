Instructions for developers

For each client we have created a separate branch
to work for a client switch to client branch and git latest code from for example forear girls college branch is branch_forward
to work for forward college, checkout this branch and work in it, then on client machine pull this branch

If your you are working on a routine task not special for any client but for improvment of application, then get a new barnch from master
related to your name e.g new branch will be branch_dev_shahid. work on this branch and merger it into master branch
